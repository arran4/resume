This is my resume / cv. 

You can download a compiled version from:
https://github.com/arran4/resume/releases

Or build it yoursellf, you will need to install `typst` on your platform. Details can be found here: https://typst.app/

Feel free to fork and use for your own resume, however this is based off https://typst.app/universe/package/modern-cv/ so you are best to start there, however feel free to copy the github actions code for compiling on tagging:

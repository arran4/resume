# Arran Ubels Resume


This is my attempt at a public resume / cv. An unabridged version, abridged versions might be discoverable in snapshots. If you have any suggestions, issues, and the like please raise an issue or a PR. Why else would I do this in git. 

You can download the latest compiled version (in PDF form) from:

https://github.com/arran4/resume/releases

Or build it yourself, you will need to install `typst` on your platform. Details on how to do that can be found here: 

https://typst.app/

Feel free to fork and use for your own resume, however this is based off [Modern CV](https://typst.app/universe/package/modern-cv/) so you are best to start there, however feel free to copy the github actions code for compiling on tagging:

https://github.com/arran4/resume/blob/main/.github/workflows/typst.yaml

For suggestions / updates etc, please create a fork and then from there create a PR.
